Use the WooSidebars Sidebar Manager Converter to convert your sidebars from the WooFramework's old Sidebar Manager to the new WooSidebars plugin.

== Description ==

The WooFramework by WooThemes, the code that powers all WooThemes themes, used to contain a Sidebar Manager. Over time, this feature required a re-vamping and was rewritten from the ground up as a standalone plugin. [WooSidebars](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/woosidebars/), the newly-imagined Sidebar Manager, can work with any theme that supports dynamic widget areas and is a far easier and more intuitive system.

The WooSidebars Sidebar Manager Converter plugin makes it easy to transfer your custom sidebars from the old Sidebar Manager system over to use with WooSidebars, with all conditions and settings in tact.
